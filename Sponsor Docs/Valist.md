We integrated Valist Contracts into our m3tadao contract to index m3tadao users-accounts-projects into tableland 
from m3tadao contract we are creating and updating Accounts-Projects by calling valist registry

Into the backend we are adding/removing members and we plan to also integrate the Licence contract as soon as possible!
our contract address is located here : https://github.com/Suhel-Kap/m3tadao/blob/mantine/contracts/contracts/m3taDao.sol

We also uploaded our Dapp on valist the cid-gateway url is located here =>

https://bafybeiheyxfpftfspgckcjexzgh5qq6naofbwczy7t6wql2us4ohss6yoa.ipfs.gateway.valist.io/

We are also planning in the near future to add into m3tadao git actions so any project can upload their Releases into IPFS straight from m3tadao application

Finally would like to contribute and add valist - ens support . We tried to link our valist-url with ens but currently is not supported!
