M3tadao data layer is based on IPFS&FILECOIN using web3.storage to upload images and json files. 

We used it in every class of our dapp like for storing Lens Profile & Valist Organizations-SubProjects-Posts-Hiring requests.

The hook we are using for uploading our files is located here => https://github.com/Suhel-Kap/m3tadao/blob/main/utils/uploadToIpfs.js

Also by leveraging Valist we will make more users to start upload their web3 Projects into IPFS instead of using a centralized server to store their application.

Moreover using valist we are also unlocking the opportunity to tokengate organizations services access with the valist License Project NFTs instead of using 

centralized subscriptions. 

Finally we have plans to use IPNS in some cases to save on gass and also LitProtocol for encrypting th IPNS keys for the Owners of the content!
