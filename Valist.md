We integrated Valist Contracts into our m3tadao contract to index m3tadao users-accounts-projects into tableland 
from m3tadao contract we are creating and updating Accounts-Projects by calling valist registry

Into the backend we are adding/removing members and we plan to also integrate the Licence contract as soon as possible!
our contract address is located here : https://github.com/Suhel-Kap/m3tadao/blob/mantine/contracts/contracts/m3taDao.sol
