M3tadao integrates Superfluid x Gelato to establish  programable (planned Streams) where Gelato takes the access control to start and close the streams for a user 
to do that we are using the SuperApp x Gelato contract displayed here : https://github.com/Suhel-Kap/m3tadao/blob/mantine/contracts/contracts/m3taSuperTreasure.sol

For upgrading matic to maticx authorizeOperatorWithFullControl and to call the planned stream we are using that hook :https://github.com/Suhel-Kap/m3tadao/blob/mantine/hooks/useSuperFluid.js

With programable Streams we established our goal to create a functional Dao for the next web3 projects!!!
